            We believe
            <a href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org">Agile software development</a>
            is being dumbed down, commodified,
            and is losing its spirit. We seek to replace the current
            name with one having two virtues: first, that it capture
            more exactly the attitudes originally behind Agile; second,
            that it be obscure enough that no one will assume they
            already know what it means and that&mdash;amazingly
            enough!&mdash;they are already doing it.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are two halves to the story: an attitude toward
            <strong>technology</strong>
            and an attitude toward
            <strong>the social</strong>.
            To form the Agile attitude, those two attitudes are crossed
            (hybridized) like lions or tigers are crossed to form
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liger">ligers</a>.
            Trying to separate the social from the technical is 
            <a "http://www.exampler.com/blog/2007/11/06/latour-table-of-contents/">mistake</a>.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Technology</h2>

          <p>
            Within <em>technology</em>,
            <a "http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/artisanal">artisanal</a>
            is supposed to connote:
          </p>

          
          <ul>
            <li><p>
                Higher quality and a focus on a more demanding customer.
            </p></li>

            <li><p>
                A product that&#8217;s an unusual variation on a more typical product. Typically,
                the variation is one that&#8217;s not suitable for mass production. (For example, an 
                <a href="http://www.wpr.org/book/071125b.html">artisanal apple</a>
                might not ship as well as common varieties.) In the context of software development,
                &#8220;artisanal&#8221; therefore suggests an extreme focus on the '
                <a "http://www.exampler.com/old-blog/2006/04/21/#how-to-be-a-product-diretor">product director'</a>. 
            </p></li>

            <li><p>
                A
                <a "http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/">craftsmanlike</a>
                approach to process. That process is sometimes,
                <em>but not exclusively</em>,
                &#8220;old fashioned&#8221; or manual. We are like this 
                <a href="http://njmonthly.com/articles/lifestyle/health_and_wellness/artisanal-foods.html">artisanal cheese maker</a>:

                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                  But [Wajswol] gladly lets technology lend a hand. Twice a day, in the &#8220;milking parlor,&#8221;
                  a computerized lactation carousel that handles 60 sheep at once&mdash;the only one in the
                  U.S. for sheep, Wajswol claims&mdash;milks 300 ewes per hour. In the cheese room, vats of milk
                  are heated to the precise temperatures required to activate specific strains of bacteria to produce
                  just the right texture of curd.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    &#8220;Machinery helps you pay attention to what's important,&#8221; Wajswol says.
                   &#8220;In cheese making, there are a couple of things you need to focus on. If you can eliminate
                   the nonsense&mdash;the mundane, nonskilled steps, like feeding the animals or warming milk
                   correctly&mdash;you can spend more time focusing on the texture of the curd and making sure
                   the product comes out good.&#8221;
                  </p>

          <p>But artisanal is too broad of a term. It needs to qualify something else. What?</p>

          <p>
            At a workshop once,
            <a href="http://www.mcbreen.ab.ca/">Pete McBreen</a>
            said
            &#8220;The Agile methods are methods created by people who
            like to program.&#8221; While that&#8217;s not entirely
            true, we bet it&#8217;s more true of that particular bunch
            of people than of any
            previous gaggle of methodologists. And their oddity went
            even further: a surprising number of the authors of the
            <a "http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a>
            had programmed in
            <a "http://www.smalltalk.org/main/">Smalltalk</a>.
            They
            were technology enthusiasts, and that enthusiasm&mdash;a
            &#8220;gosh wow!&#8221; enthusiasm for continuous
            integration tools, refactoring tools, programming languages,
            testing tools, and the like&mdash;has been a continuous part
            of the growth of Agile. It&#8217;s been a touch
            disreputable, though&mdash;because of the Agile
            Manifesto&#8217;s &#8220;individuals and interactions over
            processes and tools&#8221;&mdash;so we've chosen
            the artistic style called
            <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retro-futurism">retro-futurism</a></strong>
            to call renewed attention to it.
          </p>

          <p>
            We are using retro-futurism in one of its senses:
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                [a] vision of the future as seen through the eyes of the past, often a utopian society
                characterized by high technology (relative to the base time), unusual or exaggerated artistic,
                architectural, and fashion styles, and an abundance of consumer goods; its spirit of optimism
                [&#8230;] is a contrast with
                <a href="http://www.cyberpunkreview.com/what-is-cyberpunk/">cyberpunk</a>
                [&#8230;]
              </p>

              <p>
                (Quote from 
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retro-futurism">ibid</a>.)
              </p>

            </blockquote>
          </p>

          <p>
            Another way of looking at the style is as a response to
            the oft-heard complaint, &#8220;It&#8217;s the future
            now. Where&#8217;s my flying car?&#8221; The physical world
            is disappointingly short on flying cars, rocket packs, and
            all the rest. In the software world, though, we have
            flying cars: tools&mdash;and team-scale processes&mdash;that still evoke that
            old excitement and 
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_of_wonder">sense of wonder</a>.
          </p>

          <p><em>
              So. The
              <strong>technology</strong>
              half of the cross casts attention on giddy enthusiasm for both our products and how
              we build them.
          </em></p>

          <h2>The Social</h2>

          <p>
            Agile&#8217;s early emphasis on self-organizing teams caused some to brand it 
            <strong>anarchic</strong>. Soothing those fears has led, in too many cases, to team processes that are externally
            imposed and therefore ossified. To counter that trend, we want to embrace the anarchic
            strain in Agile. (What should be done to sooth fears, we believe, is nothing more than
            producing working software at frequent intervals. So long as a team delivers that which
            satisfies, no one should care if an integral part of their process is capering naked in the
            light of the full moon.)
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, we want to recenter emphasis on the
            <strong>team</strong>. Too much of modern-day Agile depends on
            <em>someone else</em>
            to make it succeed. Typically that someone is upper management, whether via
            <a href="http://www.leadersdirect.com/servant.html">servant leadership'</a>,
            outright command-and-control management, or something in between. While we
            can&#8217;t ignore the world outside the team, we think it better to take the
            attitude that, while the outside world can make Agile fail, it cannot make it
            <em>succeed</em>. Agile lives and dies by the team.
          </p>


          <p>
            Casting about for something odd that would combine
            &#8220;anarchy&#8221; and &#8220;team&#8221;, we came upon
            <strong>anarcho-syndicalism</strong>.
            <a "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-syndicalism">Anarcho-syndicalism</a>
            was an economic/political/labor movement from around 100 years
            ago. Its goal was to end the oppressive
            power&mdash;and very existence&mdash;of both the State and
            large-scale corporations by countering them with
            self-organizing trades unions. Anarcho-syndicalism&#8217;s
            concentration on the self-organization and solidarity of the
            people whose hands and minds make the product is reminiscent of Agile at its best.
          </p>

          <p>
            We are also taken by anarcho-syndicalism&#8217;s emphasis on 
            <em>direct action</em>. Others believed that the route to
            better working conditions lay in, say, electing
            representatives who would speak for the workers, but the
            anarcho-syndicalists rejected that. In that rejection, we
            hear echoes of the attitude that teams should not wait for
            <strike>daddy</strike>
            management to fix their problems.
          </p>

          <p>
            Having chosen an outlandish reference&mdash;anarcho-syndicalism? a type of omigod 
            <em>socialism</em>&mdash;we add a softening
            qualifier. Ending the State, fighting the Corporation, doing
            away with wage slavery&mdash;none of these are part of our
            programme. We&#8217;re just trying to develop good software
            in a pleasant way that makes sense. Therefore: the qualifier
            <em>team-scale</em>
            is intended to remind that our message is to the workers of a team, not the
            <a "http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/k/karlmarx109309.html">workers of the world</a>.
          </p>

          <p><em>
              So. The
              <strong>social</strong>
              half of the cross casts attention on perfecting the team. Or, rather, on the team perfecting itself.
          </em></p>

          <h2>Summary</h2>

          <p>To the extent that Agile has lost its way, a slogan that reminds us of the original path
         will help. To the extent that Agile as a movement now favors bland conformity over
         scrappiness and outrageous ideas, an outrageous slogan can help us get back to where we
            once belonged.</p>
