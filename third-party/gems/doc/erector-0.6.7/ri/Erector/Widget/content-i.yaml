  body: "Template method which must be overridden by all widget subclasses. Inside this method you call the magic #element methods which emit HTML and text to the output string. If you call &quot;super&quot; (or don't override <tt>content</tt>) then your widget will render any block that was passed into its constructor (in the current instance context so it can get access to parent widget methods via method_missing)."
