  body: To call one widget from another, inside the parent widget's <tt>content</tt> method, instantiate the child widget and call its <tt>write_via</tt> method, passing in <tt>self</tt>. This assures that the same output string is used, which gives better performance than using <tt>capture</tt> or <tt>to_s</tt>. You can also use the <tt>widget</tt> method.
