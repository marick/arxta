  body: "Returns an HTML-escaped version of its parameter. Leaves the output string untouched. Note that the #text method automatically HTML-escapes its parameter, so be careful <b>not</b> to do something like text(h(&quot;2&lt;4&quot;)) since that will double-escape the less-than sign (you'll get &quot;2&amp;amp;lt;4&quot; instead of &quot;2&amp;lt;4&quot;)."
