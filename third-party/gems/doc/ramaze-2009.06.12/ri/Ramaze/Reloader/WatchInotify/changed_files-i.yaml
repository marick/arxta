  body: "  We have to add the changed file again after we got a notification, I\n  have no idea why, but using IN_ONESHOT should make sure that there is\n  no memory leak in the C level even if we add a file again.\n  There is a memory leak however in the watch_descriptors hash, since\n  rinotify won't synchronize the contents properly and will only add to\n  the hash, so we have to clean up ourselves.\n"
