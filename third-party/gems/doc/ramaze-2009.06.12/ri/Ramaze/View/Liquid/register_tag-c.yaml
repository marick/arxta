- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Liquid has intentionally? no support for binding, in order to use helpers you have to register them as tags.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Creating a tag needs boilerplate, so we reduce that for your convenience.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This is not the most performant way, it seems like Liquid uses initialize to compile templates and gives you the chance to process the arguments to the tag only once, but if you want that please contribute.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Further below are a couple of tags that map to the most common helpers, this also needs contribution as I simply don't have the time to write all of that and invent a consistent syntax.
