- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Innate support simple routing using string, regex and lambda based routers. Route are stored in a dictionary, which supports hash-like access but preserves order, so routes are evaluated in the order they are added.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This middleware should wrap Innate::DynaMap.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Please note that Rack::File is put before Route and Rewrite, that means that you cannot apply routes to static files unless you add your own route middleware before.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "String routers are the simplest way to route in Innate. One path is translated into another:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  Innate::Route[ '/foo' ] = '/bar'\n    '/foo'  =&gt;  '/bar'\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Regex routers allow matching against paths using regex. Matches within your regex using () are substituted in the new path using printf-like syntax.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  Innate::Route[ %r!^/(\\d+)\\.te?xt$! ] = &quot;/text/%d&quot;\n    '/123.txt'  =&gt;  '/text/123'\n    '/789.text' =&gt;  '/text/789'\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: For more complex routing, lambda routers can be used. Lambda routers are passed in the current path and request object, and must return either a new path string, or nil.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  Innate::Route[ 'name of route' ] = lambda{ |path, request|\n    '/bar' if path == '/foo' and request[:bar] == '1'\n  }\n    '/foo'        =&gt;  '/foo'\n    '/foo?bar=1'  =&gt;  '/bar'\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "Lambda routers can also use this alternative syntax:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  Innate::Route('name of route') do |path, request|\n    '/bar' if path == '/foo' and request[:bar] == '1'\n  end\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "NOTE: Use self::ROUTES notation in singleton methods to force correct"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "      lookup.\n"
