  # An application is a collection of controllers and options that have a
  # common name.
  # Every application has a location it dispatches from, this behaves similar
  # to Rack::URLMap.

  # App is the superclass for applications and acts as their prototype when it
  # comes to configuration.
  #
  # An application consists of options, a location, and a list of objects. The
  # objects are usually {Controller}s.
  #
  # The options are inherited, the basics are set in Ramaze.options, from there
  # to Ramaze::App.options, and finally into every instance of App.
  #
  # This allows to collect {Controller}s of your application into a common
  # group that can easily be used in other applications, while retaining the
  # original options.
  #
  # Every instance of {App} is mapped in {AppMap}, which is the default
  # location to #call from Rack.
  #
  # Additionally, every {App} can have custom locations for
  # root/public/view/layout directories, which allows reuse beyond directory
  # boundaries.
  #
  # In contrast to Innate, where all Nodes share the same middleware, {App}
  # also has a subset of middleware that handles serving static files, routes
  # and rewrites.
  #
  # To indicate that a {Controller} belongs to a specific application, you can
  # pass a second argument to {Controller::map}
  #
  # @example adding Controller to application
  #
  #   class WikiController < Ramaze::Controller
  #     map '/', :wiki
  #   end
  #
  # The App instance will be created for you and if you don't use any other
  # applications in your code there is nothing else you have to do. Others can
  # now come and simply reuse your code in their own applications.
  #
  # There is some risk of name collisions if everybody calls their app `:wiki`,
  # but given that you only use one foreign app of this kind might give less
  # reason for concern.
  #
  # If you still try to use two apps with the same name, you have to be
  # careful, loading one first, renaming it, then loading the second one.
  #
  # The naming of an App has no influence on any other aspects of dispatching
  # or configuration.
